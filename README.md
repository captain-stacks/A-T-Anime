Forked https://github.com/Connor2h/A-T-Anime by @Connor2h so I could contribute to the project.

This project was previously deployed on Heroku, but found itself without a home when their free service was eliminated. I investigated how to deploy this app on Vercel, and made the required updates to enable that. My changes were incorporated with this pull request: https://github.com/Connor2h/A-T-Anime/pull/23
